# Eco Mentor

Regenerated with improvements and UI preserved.

Eco Mentor is a GPT-5 powered virtual sustainability mentor for children and young learners. It combines conventional AI, gamified eco-quests, and safe, age-appropriate education to teach green skills in a fun and engaging way.

## Core Features
1. **Conventional Learning:** Kids ask, "How can I save water?" or "What's composting?" GPT-5 responds with friendly, age-appropriate answers.
2. **Interactive Quizzes:** GPT-5 generates mini-games ("How many liters can you save by fixing a leak?") to reinforce learning.
3. **Eco Challenges Engine:** It proposes gamified real-life tasks ("Collect plastic from your neighborhood and recycle!"), logs progress, rewards with digital points.
4. **Safe, Simple UI:** Friendly character avatar, and clean chat interface with large buttons for kids.
